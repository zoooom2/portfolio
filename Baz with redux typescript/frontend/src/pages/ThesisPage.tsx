            We do not exist as a singular element. Our genetic make up is a
            stepping stone to our individuality, but even then, our genetic make
            up is not a singular entity. As we grow, we learn and unlearn, we
            experience and we forget, we take and we give back. Thereâ€™s more
            variation in our individuality per day.

            their principles, their thoughts and processes, we take all they
            have and more to create our own defination of fashion from it.

            desire for revolution.
